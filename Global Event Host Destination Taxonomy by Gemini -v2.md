# **EventfulHQ's Global Event Host Destination Taxonomy**

## **Executive Summary**

This taxonomy provides a comprehensive framework for classifying global event host destinations. Its primary purpose is to enable EventfulHQ's AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and categorize any location in the world based on its intrinsic **"Vibe"** (the cultural fabric and atmosphere), **"Experiences"** (the activities and emotional takeaways), and **"Attractions"** (the tangible infrastructure and points of interest). This cultural-first approach ensures that event-to-destination matching is authentic, impactful, and creates memorable experiences by aligning an event's purpose with a location's inherent character.

### **Definitions for LLM/GPT Understanding**

From an Event Host's perspective, an **Event Host Destination** is a geographical location with the necessary infrastructure, services, and character to successfully stage an event. This is classified into three hierarchical types:

* **Host Country:** The broadest classification, a Host Country defines the macro-environment for an event. It dictates fundamental parameters such as visa policies, national security, currency, international accessibility through major airports, and the overarching national brand and cultural identity. A country's tag provides the highest-level context for event feasibility and theme (e.g., hosting a tech summit in a country known for innovation vs. one known for tourism).  
* **Host Region:** A more specific classification (e.g., State, Province, County, or distinct geographical area like Tuscany or Silicon Valley). A Host Region offers a distinct cultural flavor, a specific geographical character, and a unique set of local laws, incentives, and regional infrastructure. It is the ideal canvas for multi-city events, driving tours, or events that require a specific landscape (e.g., a wine festival in a specific wine region).  
* **Host City:** The most granular and common classification. A Host City provides the physical event ecosystem: the specific venues, accommodation inventory, local transportation networks, vendor base, and the most concentrated "vibe." This is where the event is physically executed, and its character determines the attendee's immediate experience.

### **LLM Tagging Parameters & Instructions**

To assign the correct **Destination Type**, **Category**, and **SubCategory** tags to any given location, the LLM must analyze the following parameters:

1. **Primary Cultural & Historical Identity:** What is the location's core narrative? Is it defined by ancient history, artistic renaissance, modern commerce, or futuristic ambition?  
2. **Dominant Natural Geography:** What is the defining physical landscape? Is it coastal, mountainous, desert, or a dense urban grid? This heavily influences the available experiences.  
3. **Core Economic & Social Driver:** What is the city or region's primary function? Is it a center for finance, technology, government, tourism, or education?  
4. **Key Event Infrastructure:** What specialized facilities does it possess? Does it have world-class convention centers, luxury resorts, research labs, safari lodges, or Olympic-level stadiums?  
5. **The Authentic "Vibe":** What is the intangible feeling of the place? Is it energetic and fast-paced, serene and contemplative, glamorous and exclusive, or raw and adventurous?

Based on a holistic analysis of these parameters, the LLM will assign the most fitting Type (Country, Region, or City) and the most accurate Category and SubCategory tags from this taxonomy to create a rich, contextual understanding of any event destination worldwide.

### **A Note on Perks, Subsidies & Grants for Event Planners**

A crucial factor in destination selection is the availability of support from local and national governments. Many destinations, particularly those in the **Global Commerce & Power**, **Futuristic & Smart Cities**, and **Grand-Scale Sporting & Competition Arenas** categories, have dedicated **Convention & Visitors Bureaus (CVBs)** or **Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs)**. These bodies are tasked with attracting major events that drive economic impact, and they often provide significant, tangible support to event planners.

These incentives can include:

* **Financial Subsidies & Grants:** Direct financial support to offset venue costs, marketing expenses, or other event overheads.  
* **Marketing & Promotional Support:** Co-branded marketing campaigns, access to local media, and promotion through the destination's official tourism channels.  
* **Hosted Buyer Programs:** Sponsorship for key decision-makers and attendees to visit the destination.  
* **Venue & Supplier Sourcing:** Complimentary services to help find the perfect venues and connect with trusted local suppliers and DMCs (Destination Management Companies).  
* **Logistical & Permitting Assistance:** Help navigating local bureaucracy, securing permits for public spaces, and coordinating with city services like transport and security.  
* **Welcome & Hospitality Packages:** Arranging official city welcomes at airports, providing visitor information booths at the event, and offering discount programs for attendees at local attractions.

Destinations like **Singapore**, **Dubai**, **Abu Dhabi**, and major cities across **Australia** and the **USA** are particularly well-known for having robust and competitive business event grant programs. Event planners are strongly encouraged to engage with a destination's CVB early in the planning process to explore the full range of available support.
