### Executive Summary

This Global Event Venue Taxonomy serves as the definitive classification framework for EventfulHQ's AI-powered platform, organizing the world's diverse event venues into 15 distinct categories with 3 specialized subcategories each. This taxonomy enables precise venue matching for all event types defined in our Global Events Taxonomy, from intimate birthday celebrations to Olympic ceremonies, ensuring optimal venue-event alignment across cultural, geographical, and operational boundaries.

The classification system recognizes three fundamental venue types: **Indoor Venues** (climate-controlled enclosed spaces), **Outdoor Venues** (open-air natural or constructed environments), and **Hybrid Venues** (integrated indoor-outdoor capabilities). Each category represents distinct operational workflows, amenities requirements, and execution competencies necessary for delivering exceptional event experiences.

This framework empowers AI systems to understand venue capabilities, match appropriate facilities to event requirements, and predict operational success factors across the global events ecosystem. Every venue category is designed to support specific event purposes while delivering unique experiences through carefully curated utility features.
